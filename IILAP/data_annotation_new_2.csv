"Russia timezones","Russia has the second most time zones in the world, with 15 different time zones across its vast landmass. Its huge size stretches across much of northern Asia and eastern Europe, covering a wide range of longitudes. Unlike France, which gains extra time zones from overseas territories, Russia’s time zones come solely from its continuous land area. Despite its size, it has fewer time zones than France because France’s scattered overseas territories add extra zones beyond its mainland.","["".
