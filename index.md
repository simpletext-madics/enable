# ENABLE: Exploring New Artificial-intelligence Benefits for Language and Education

## Abstract 
`The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has been characterized by periods of high optimism and anticipation, occasionally accompanied by disillusionment. Nonetheless, there has been a recent and continuous increase in interest, coupled with the successful deployment of AI in various crucial domains.  Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT (and ChatGPT), Llama, and Bing AI Chat, are changing education and information access while Google Translate and DeepL have drastically transformed the world of translation. The ENABLE project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of the successful existing deployment of LLMs such as ChatGPT and DeepL and the impact they have on education and translation in particular. Based on this in-depth analysis of the benefits and the limitations of the LLMs, we will investigate how exactly they are changing these domains and how we should adapt training programs to better prepare students for a changing labor market.`
